Memo to Raquel:

This is what I have done so far:

Ceated folders: server client
Set up Node.js server: cd into server & npm init -y
Installed Express, Nodemon and the Cors: npm i express cors nodemon
Created index file (the entry point to the web server): touch index.js
Added the following in index.js:

const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const app = express();
const PORT = 4000;

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());

app.get("/api", (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        message: "Hello world",
    });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on ${PORT}`);
});

Added  "start": "nodemon index.js" on "scripts" section in packege.json file 

Created a react app in the client folder: npx create-react-app ww
Installed react-router-dom
